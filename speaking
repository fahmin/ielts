What do you dislike about X?
What do you dislike about parties?

I absolutely hate going to the cinema.

changes will happen due to technology

yes i have thought about this a lot recently ., actually i believe techno;logy will continue to transform our lives
dramatically. for instance i am quite sure that cell phone will be like wristwatch and will be activated by vocie 
control, rather than pressing buttons to input numbers. i am also convinced that technology will contributye enormously to
advance in medical industry. for exmaple i think that in about 50 years , we will have found a cure for cancer and other serious
diseases



.1 think that given the current rate of development, Vietnam will be a verJI strong
and modern countr~ in quite a sbort time. At the moment the cities are becoming
more and more modern, people are constructing more and more office blocks,
and traditional residential areas are disappearing at an alarming rate. Taking all
these facts into consideration, J have 110 doubt that Vietnam will be a safer, cleaner
and more beautiful and convenient place to live in the future ... A lot of scientists
are suggesting that due to global warming, it is very liI~ly that we willface serious
problems in the next 30 years ...
